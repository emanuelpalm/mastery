This repository links to all repositories related to the Mastery project. It may also eventually contain scripts for deploying the application.

The Mastery project is a multi-player game where each player acts as a wizard. The project is part of a master-level course, and there are no guarantees whatsoever about how feature-complete the game will eventually become.
